# LeonimusT.com
This is the public projet of my website [leonimust.com](https://leonimust.com) \
This will probably not get any update whatsoever so take it and play with it :3\
Also the old methamphetamine.solutions website is in the **meth.zip** file, all working locally

# How to use
1. Install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/prebuilt-installer), I use v20.11.0
2. Go into the projet and type "npm i" in the console
3. To run type "npm run start" and the website will be running at http://localhost:3000
