    <p class="textiboi">
      This Privacy Policy describes how the Delay Your Purchases application
      ("the App") handles
      your information. LeonimusT is committed to protecting your privacy and
      ensuring transparency
      about our data practices.
    </p>
    <p class="textiboi">
      Please read this Privacy Policy carefully to understand how we handle your
      data when you use
      our App.

  <div class="legal-section animated fadeIn" style="animation-delay: 0.2s;">
    <h2 class="textiboi">Data We Collect</h2>
    <p class="textiboi">
      The Delay Your Purchases app collects and stores the following information
      locally on your device to provide its purchase decision tracking
      functionality:
    </p>
    <ul class="textiboi">
      <li><strong>Purchase Items:</strong> Names and descriptions of items
        you're considering purchasing</li>
      <li><strong>Decision Dates:</strong> The dates you set to make decisions
        about purchases</li>
      <li><strong>Notes and Comments:</strong> Any personal notes or thoughts
        you add about items</li>
      <li><strong>Timestamps:</strong> When items were added and status changes
        occurred</li>
      <li><strong>Purchase Decisions:</strong> Your choices (buy, don't buy,
        delay further)</li>
      <li><strong>Price Information:</strong> Any price data you choose to
        record</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="textiboi">
      All data is stored <strong>locally on your device only</strong>. We do not
      have access to any of your information.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="legal-section animated fadeIn" style="animation-delay: 0.3s;">
    <h2 class="textiboi">Data Storage - Local Only</h2>
    <p class="textiboi">
      The Delay Your Purchases app is designed with <strong>privacy as the core
        principle</strong>. All your
      purchase decision data is stored <strong>exclusively on your
        device</strong>.
      This means:
    </p>
    <ul class="textiboi">
      <li>Your purchase lists and notes never leave your device</li>
      <li>We do not have access to your data</li>
      <li>Your data is not uploaded to any servers or cloud services</li>
      <li>No user accounts are created or maintained</li>
      <li>We cannot see, access, or recover your data</li>
      <li>Your information remains entirely under your control</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="textiboi">
      Your privacy is guaranteed by the App's architecture—there is simply no
      mechanism for data to leave your device.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="legal-section animated fadeIn" style="animation-delay: 0.4s;">
    <h2 class="textiboi">Zero Network Connectivity</h2>
    <p class="textiboi">
      The Delay Your Purchases app makes <strong>absolutely no network
        requests</strong>. This app is
      designed to function completely offline with no internet connection
      required:
    </p>
    <ul class="textiboi">
      <li>No external API calls or web requests of any kind</li>
      <li>No image fetching from external sources</li>
      <li>No connection to our servers (we don't have any for this app)</li>
      <li>No data synchronization or cloud backup</li>
      <li>No communication with third-party services</li>
      <li>Works entirely offline once installed</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="textiboi">
      This complete offline functionality is a <strong>privacy
        feature</strong>—your purchase decisions
      and shopping habits remain private and local to your device.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="legal-section animated fadeIn" style="animation-delay: 0.5s;">
    <h2 class="textiboi">How We Use Your Data</h2>
    <p class="textiboi">
      The information you enter is used exclusively for the following purposes:
    </p>
    <ul class="textiboi">
      <li>To display your list of items you're considering purchasing</li>
      <li>To track decision deadlines and send local notifications (if
        enabled)</li>
      <li>To maintain your purchase decision history</li>
      <li>To help you manage impulse purchases and make mindful buying
        decisions</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="textiboi">
      We do not use your data for analytics, advertising, marketing, or any
      purpose beyond providing the core App functionality.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="legal-section animated fadeIn" style="animation-delay: 0.6s;">
    <h2 class="textiboi">No Data Collection</h2>
    <p class="textiboi">
      We want to be completely transparent: The Delay Your Purchases app does
      NOT collect,
      transmit, store on servers, or process any of the following:
    </p>
    <ul class="textiboi">
      <li>Personal identification information (name, email, phone number,
        etc.)</li>
      <li>Device identifiers or unique user IDs</li>
      <li>Usage analytics or behavior tracking data</li>
      <li>Location data or GPS coordinates</li>
      <li>Contact lists or address books</li>
      <li>Crash reports or diagnostic data transmitted to us</li>
      <li>Browsing history or app usage patterns</li>
      <li>Any other personal or sensitive information</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="textiboi">
      Since we don't collect any data from your device, we have nothing to
      share, sell, or use for marketing purposes.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="legal-section animated fadeIn" style="animation-delay: 0.7s;">
    <h2 class="textiboi">No Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p class="textiboi">
      The App does not integrate with any third-party analytics services,
      advertising networks, or
      data collection platforms. This includes:
    </p>
    <ul class="textiboi">
      <li>No analytics services (Google Analytics, Mixpanel, etc.)</li>
      <li>No advertising networks or ad tracking</li>
      <li>No social media integrations</li>
      <li>No crash reporting services that transmit data</li>
      <li>No cloud storage or backup services</li>
      <li>No payment processors or e-commerce integrations</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="textiboi">
      The App has zero external dependencies for its core functionality.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="legal-section animated fadeIn" style="animation-delay: 0.8s;">
    <h2 class="textiboi">No User Accounts</h2>
    <p class="textiboi">
      The Delay Your Purchases app does not require or support user accounts,
      authentication,
      or login systems. You can use the App completely anonymously without
      providing any personal
      information whatsoever.
    </p>
    <p class="textiboi">
      There are no passwords, usernames, email registrations, or account
      management features.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="legal-section animated fadeIn" style="animation-delay: 0.9s;">
    <h2 class="textiboi">Local Notifications</h2>
    <p class="textiboi">
      If you enable notifications, the App may send you local reminders about
      decision deadlines:
    </p>
    <ul class="textiboi">
      <li>All notifications are generated <strong>locally on your
          device</strong></li>
      <li>No push notification services or external servers are involved</li>
      <li>Notification content never leaves your device</li>
      <li>You can disable notifications at any time in system settings</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="textiboi">
      These are local device notifications only, not remote push notifications.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="legal-section animated fadeIn" style="animation-delay: 1s;">
    <h2 class="textiboi">Data Security</h2>
    <p class="textiboi">
      Since all your data is stored locally on your device, the security of your
      data depends on
      the security measures you have in place on your device, including:
    </p>
    <ul class="textiboi">
      <li>Device lock screens and passwords/PINs/biometrics</li>
      <li>Operating system security settings</li>
      <li>Device encryption (if available and enabled)</li>
      <li>Physical security of your device</li>
      <li>App permissions and access controls</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="textiboi">
      We recommend ensuring your device has appropriate security measures
      enabled to protect your
      locally stored purchase decision data. The App stores data using secure
      device storage mechanisms, but ultimate security depends on your device's
      protection.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="legal-section animated fadeIn" style="animation-delay: 1.1s;">
    <h2 class="textiboi">Data Retention</h2>
    <p class="textiboi">
      Your purchase decision data is stored locally on your device for as long
      as you choose:
    </p>
    <ul class="textiboi">
      <li>You can manually delete individual items or entire purchase lists at
        any time</li>
      <li>All data is removed when you uninstall the App</li>
      <li>No data is retained on our servers (we don't store any user data)</li>
      <li>You have complete control over your data retention</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="legal-section animated fadeIn" style="animation-delay: 1.2s;">
    <h2 class="textiboi">Data Backup and Loss</h2>
    <p class="textiboi">
      Because the App stores data locally without cloud backup, you are
      responsible for backing up
      your data. LeonimusT cannot recover lost data if:
    </p>
    <ul class="textiboi">
      <li>Your device is lost, stolen, or damaged</li>
      <li>You uninstall the App without backing up your data</li>
      <li>Your device experiences a system failure or data corruption</li>
      <li>You reset or replace your device without transferring data</li>
      <li>The App is deleted or data is cleared</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="textiboi">
      We recommend regularly exporting your purchase lists (if the App provides
      this feature)
      or using your device's built-in backup solutions to prevent data loss.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="legal-section animated fadeIn" style="animation-delay: 1.3s;">
    <h2 class="textiboi">Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p class="textiboi">
      The App does not collect any personal information from anyone, including
      children under 13.
      Since no data is collected or transmitted to external services, the App is
      safe for users of
      all ages from a privacy perspective.
    </p>
    <p class="textiboi">
      Parents should supervise children's use of the App and ensure they
      understand responsible purchasing decisions.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="legal-section animated fadeIn" style="animation-delay: 1.4s;">
    <h2 class="textiboi">Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p class="textiboi">
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in
      our practices or
      for legal, operational, or regulatory reasons. Any changes will be posted
      on this page with
      an updated "Last Updated" date.
    </p>
    <p class="textiboi">
      If we make significant changes that affect how we handle your information,
      we will notify
      users through appropriate channels (such as an in-app notice or website
      announcement).
    </p>
  </div>

    <h2 class="textiboi">Your Rights</h2>

    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="legal-section animated fadeIn" style="animation-delay: 1.6s;">
    <h2 class="textiboi">Solana dApp Store Distribution</h2>
    <p class="textiboi">
      The Delay Your Purchases app is distributed through the Solana dApp Store.
      Please note
      that the dApp Store itself may have its own privacy policies and data
